MSP430-Gamepad
==============

Can be put into Energia in order to program the button box controller

OR, take the EASY WAY, and use their tool- it is the 
FRC Gamepad Tool - this needs to use labview though, but the C code should compile anyways

https://github.com/TI-FIRST/FRC-Gamepad-Tool/releases

very easy to run and set up- but if we do it the energia way, we can set exactly what pin does what, rather than choosing different presets
